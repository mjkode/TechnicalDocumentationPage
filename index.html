            <h5>From Humble Beginings...</h5>
            <p style="margin-left:20px;"><i>Arpanet is a computer network developed by the Advanced Research Project Agency (now the Defense Advance Research Projects Agency) in the 1960s and 1970s as a means of communication between research laboratories and universities. ARPANET was the predecessor to the Internet. Creating a communications system that could survive a nuclear war was a major impetus behind the development of this system.</i>

            <h5>Official Definition...</h5>
            <p style="margin-left:20px;"><i>On October 24, 1995, the FNC unanimously passed a resolution defining the term Internet. This definition was developed in consultation with the leadership of the Internet and Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) Communities.
            RESOLUTION:
            "The Federal Networking Council (FNC) agrees that the following language reflects our definition of the term "Internet". "Internet" refers to the global information system that --
              <ul>
                <li>is logically linked together by a globally unique address space based on the Internet Protocol (IP) or its subsequent extensions/follow-ons;</li>
                <li>is able to support communications using the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) suite or its subsequent extensions/follow-ons, and/or other IP-compatible protocols; and</li>
                <li>provides, uses or makes accessible, either publicly or privately, high level services layered on the communications and related infrastructure described herein."</li>
              </ul></i>

            The Internet is NOT the same thing as the World Wide Web. The Internet is a series of connections, and the World Wide Web(WWW) is a protocal that runs on the Internet. Think of the Internet as a hiway, and the World Wide Web is a divided lane on that hiway. Here are just a few of the protocols(lanes) that run on the Internet...
            <ul>
              <li>HTTP: hypertext transfer protocol(www)</li>
              <li>FTP: file transfer protcol</li>
              <li>SMTP: simple mail transfer protocol</li>
              <li>TELNET: teletype network</li>

            <h5>Creation...</h5>
            <p style="margin-left:20px;">
              <i>In 1989, Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web, an Internet-based hypermedia initiative for global information sharing while at CERN, the European Particle Physics Laboratory. He wrote the first web client and server in 1990. His specifications of URIs, HTTP and HTML were refined as web technology spread.

            <h5>First Website...</h5>
            <p style="margin-left:20px;">The first web page went live on August 6, 1991. It was dedicated to information on the World Wide Web project and was made by Tim Berners-Lee. It ran on a NeXT computer at the European Organization for Nuclear Research, CERN.

              <code style="margin-left:40px;">
               The WorldWideWeb (W3) is a wide-area hypermedia information retrieval initiative aiming to give univers access to a large universe of documents.</code>
              <code style="margin-left:40px;">
                IMPORTANT: Get and read the files COPYRIGHT and CERN before downloading other files. This directory contains binaries for the NeXTSTEP Web browser
              application.</code>

                THE EDITOR
                <br>
                WorldWideWeb_0.16.tar.Z is the only wysiwyg hypertext editor for the NeXT.  It has limitations and bugs -- it can't access Gopher, FTP sites, etc.  But it is a hypertext editor!</code>
              <code style="margin-left:40px;">THE BROWSER
                <br>  
                The file labelled 1.0 is a pre-alpha browser which uses the libwww library, so you can get multimedia files etc etc.  Does doc format conversion, etc.

            ... from the begining untill the release of the WWW</p>
          <p style="margin-left:40px;">
              <strong>1965:</strong> Two computers at MIT Lincoln Lab communicate with one another using packet-switching technology.</p>
            <p style="margin-left:40px;">
              <strong>1968:</strong> Beranek and Newman, Inc. (BBN) unveils the final version of the Interface Message Processor (IMP) specifications. BBN wins ARPANET contract.</p>
            <p style="margin-left:40px;">
              <strong>1969:</strong> On Oct. 29, UCLA&rsquo;s Network Measurement Center, Stanford Research Institute (SRI), University of California-Santa Barbara and University of Utah install nodes. The <a href="https://www.livescience.com/5839-40-years-message-conceived-internet.html">first message</a> is &quot;LO,&quot; which was an attempt by student Charles Kline to &quot;LOGIN&quot; to the SRI computer from the university. However, the message was unable to be completed because the SRI system crashed.</p>
            <p style="margin-left:40px;">
              <strong>1972:</strong> BBN&rsquo;s Ray Tomlinson introduces network email. The Internetworking Working Group (INWG) forms to address need for establishing standard protocols.</p>
            <p style="margin-left:40px;">
              <strong>1973:</strong> Global networking becomes a reality as the University College of London (England) and Royal Radar Establishment (Norway) connect to ARPANET. The term <a href="http://internet-browser-review.toptenreviews.com/important-events-in-the-history-of-the-world-wide-web.html">Internet</a> is born.</p>
            <p style="margin-left:40px;">
              <strong>1974: </strong>The first Internet Service Provider (ISP) is born with the introduction of a commercial version of ARPANET, known as Telenet.</p>
            <p style="margin-left:40px;">
              <strong>1974: </strong>Vinton Cerf and Bob Kahn (the duo said by many to be the <a href="http://www.technewsdaily.com/17229-who-invented-the-internet.html">Fathers of the Internet</a>) publish &quot;A Protocol for Packet Network Interconnection,&quot; which details the design of TCP.</p>
            <p style="margin-left:40px;">
              <strong>1976: </strong>Queen Elizabeth II hits the &ldquo;send button&rdquo; on her first email.</p>

            <p style="margin-left:40px;">
              <strong>1982: </strong>Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and Internet Protocol (IP), as the protocol suite, commonly known as TCP/IP, emerge as the protocol for ARPANET. This results in the fledgling definition of the Internet as connected TCP/IP internets. TCP/IP remains the standard protocol for the Internet.</p>
            <p style="margin-left:40px;">
              <strong>1983:</strong> The <a href="http://www.businessnewsdaily.com/1108-icann-new-domain-names-top-level-domains.html">Domain Name System</a> (DNS) establishes the familiar .edu, .gov, .com, .mil, .org, .net, and .int system for naming websites. This is easier to remember than the previous designation for websites, such as 123.456.789.10.</p>
            <p style="margin-left:40px;">
              <strong>1984: </strong>William Gibson, author of &quot;Neuromancer,&quot; is the first to use the term &quot;cyberspace.&quot;</p>

            <p style="margin-left:40px;">
              <strong>1986:</strong> The National Science Foundation&rsquo;s NSFNET goes online to connected supercomputer centers at 56,000 bits per second &mdash; the speed of a typical dial-up computer modem. Over time the network speeds up and regional research and education networks, supported in part by NSF, are connected to the NSFNET backbone &mdash; effectively expanding the Internet throughout the United States. The NSFNET was essentially a network of networks that connected academic users along with the ARPANET.</p>
            <p style="margin-left:40px;">
              <strong>1987:</strong> The number of hosts on the Internet exceeds 20,000. Cisco ships its first <a href="http://www.technewsdaily.com/15648-what-is-a-router.html">router</a>.</p>
            <p style="margin-left:40px;">
              <strong>1989:</strong> World.std.com becomes the first commercial <a href="http://www.technewsdaily.com/15403-isp.html">provider of dial-up access to the Internet</a>.</p>
            <p style="margin-left:40px;">
              <strong>1990: </strong><a href="http://www.technewsdaily.com/2057-the-man-who-invented-the-world-wide-web-.html">Tim Berners-Lee</a>, a scientist at CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research, develops HyperText Markup Language (HTML). This technology continues to have a large impact on how we navigate and view the Internet today.</p>

User Story #2: Within the #main-doc element, I can see several section elements, each with a class of main-section. There should be a minimum of 5.
User Story #3: The first element within each .main-section should be a header element which contains text that describes the topic of that section.
User Story #4: Each section element with the class of main-section should also have an id that corresponds with the text of each header contained within it. Any spaces should be replaced with underscores (e.g. The section that contains the header "Javascript and Java" should have a corresponding id="Javascript_and_Java").
User Story #5: The .main-section elements should contain at least 10 p elements total (not each).
User Story #6: The .main-section elements should contain at least 5 code elements total (not each).
User Story #7: The .main-section elements should contain at least 5 li items total (not each).
User Story #8: I can see a nav element with a corresponding id="navbar".
User Story #9: The navbar element should contain one header element which contains text that describes the topic of the technical documentation.
